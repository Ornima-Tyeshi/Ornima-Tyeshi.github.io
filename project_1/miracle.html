<p> Miracle Garden every year from mid-November to mid-May, a 72,000 sqm space full of scents and colours comes to life. This incredible experience is one of Cityland’s signature creations – Dubai Miracle Garden. It was launched on Valentine’s Day, 2013, and is set in the heart of Dubailand.

Seeing the garden in full bloom with its 150 million flowers arranged in colourful arches and patterns, and the myriad shapes they form, is truly magnificent. Dubai Miracle Garden’s breathtaking landscaping has earned two Guinness World Records for the largest vertical garden in 2013 and world’s largest floral sculpture forming the shape of an Airbus A380 in 2016.

We received the accolade for the Tallest Topiary Sculpture on 25 Feb 2018. The 18 metre sculpture feature is Disney’s first character floral display in the Middle East and is made from almost 100,000 plants and flowers, and weighs almost 35tons.

Each year Dubai Miracle Garden reinvents itself, as we bring a whole new concept and design experience to our visitors. The community has given its own endorsement with more than 1.5 million visitors per year.
